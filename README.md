# hello-world
A bit about myself: 
My name is Geron Nanini and I am a student currently studying Software/Computer Systems Engineering at Queensland University of Technology. Coding interests me because it presents endless opportunities for innovation. I have always been a creative individual and coding gives me a medium to turn my creativity into something meaningful.
